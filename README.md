# Notice

Main branch currently support the drand-go 1.5.8 binary . To check for versions greater than this , look into the other branches

# drand-rs

**This project is currently at the prototype stage and does not contain full functionality. Codebase uploaded only for demonstration purpose and does not reflect the final quiality. For production usage, please visit [Drand Golang implementation](https://github.com/drand/drand)**


## Motivation
We aim to enhance the robustness and security of linked nodes by mitigating the risk of a single point of failure associated with software implementation. Additionally, we are exploring the opportunities of the system in terms of Rust language features.

## Functionality

- General picture of implemented modules mapped into [two phases of public randomness](https://github.com/drand/drand?tab=readme-ov-file#public-randomness). Aligned to be compatible with v1.5.8 drand golang implementation.

## How to run:
Binaries in [make_demo](/make_demo/) folder can be reused or obtained in next 2 steps:
1. Compile project using one of the features to specify backend:
```bash
cargo build --release --features arkworks
# or
cargo build --release --features blstrs
```
2. Download golang binary [binary v1.5.8](https://github.com/drand/drand/releases/tag/v1.5.8-testnest) (tested on linux amd64)

Rename binaries into **drand_go** and **drand_rs** accordingly and place them into [make_demo](/make_demo/) folder.

Execute **./run** script to start Setup and Generation. Script configured to perform next scenario

 ```
 Setup and Generation: 

                  Group: 4 nodes                     Scheme              beacon id
           leader: golang impl (1 node)       pedersen-bls-chained          AAA
           members: rust impl  (3 nodes)      pedersen-bls-unchained        BBB
                                              bls-unchained-g1-rfc9380      CCC
```

Number of nodes can be modified for various scenaries, for example:
 ```
 Setup and Generation: 

                  Group: 4 nodes                     Scheme              beacon id
           leader: golang impl (1 node)       pedersen-bls-chained          AAA
           members: rust impl  (3 nodes)

                  Group: 7 nodes                     Scheme              beacon id
           leader: golang impl (1 node)       pedersen-bls-unchained        BBB
           members: rust impl  (6 nodes)     

                  Group: 10 nodes                     Scheme             beacon id
           leader: golang impl (1 node)       bls-unchained-g1-rfc9380      CCC
           members: rust impl  (9 nodes)
